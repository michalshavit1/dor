Why did the kid cross the playground? To get to the other slide.
Why is Peter Pan always flying? Because he Neverlands.
Why did the tomato blush? Because it saw the salad dressing.

Did you know that protons have mass? I didn't even know they were catholic.
I knew I shouldn't steal a mixer from work, but it was a whisk I was willing to take.
