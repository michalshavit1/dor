Dad Im hungry  Hi hungry Im dad
I'm tired of following my dreams. I'm just going to ask them where they are going and meet up with them later.
What did one nut say as he chased another nut?  I'm a cashew!
What creature is smarter than a talking parrot? A spelling bee.
What is a centipedes's favorite Beatle song?  I want to hold your hand, hand, hand, hand...
Why didnt the skeleton cross the road? Because he had no guts.
Why was it called the dark ages? Because of all the knights.
