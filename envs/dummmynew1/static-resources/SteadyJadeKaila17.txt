Slept like a log last night  woke up in the fireplace.
I'm tired of following my dreams. I'm just going to ask them where they are going and meet up with them later.
Why is Peter Pan always flying? Because he Neverlands.
Why does a Moon-rock taste better than an Earth-rock? Because it's a little meteor.
Why did the tomato blush? Because it saw the salad dressing.
My first time using an elevator was an uplifting experience. The second time let me down.
