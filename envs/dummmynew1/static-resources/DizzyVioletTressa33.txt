Slept like a log last night  woke up in the fireplace.
Why was it called the dark ages? Because of all the knights. 
Why is Peter Pan always flying? Because he Neverlands.
What do you do on a remote island? Try and find the TV island it belongs to.
Why did the kid cross the playground? To get to the other slide.
Why did the tomato blush? Because it saw the salad dressing.
I'm tired of following my dreams. I'm just going to ask them where they are going and meet up with them later.
I'll tell you what often gets over looked... garden fences.
Why do birds fly south for the winter? Because it's too far to walk.
What do you do on a remote island? Try and find the TV island it belongs to.
