How come the stadium got hot after the game? Because all of the fans left.
Why did the tomato blush? Because it saw the salad dressing.
Why is Peter Pan always flying? Because he Neverlands.
Why do birds fly south for the winter? Because it's too far to walk.
My first time using an elevator was an uplifting experience. The second time let me down.
