Dad Im hungry  Hi hungry Im dad
How come the stadium got hot after the game? Because all of the fans left.
Why did the kid cross the playground? To get to the other slide.
Why didnt the skeleton cross the road? Because he had no guts.
Why do birds fly south for the winter? Because it's too far to walk.
